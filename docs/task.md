## Proposed Team Responsibilities

#### Proposal: Adam and Claire
Description: After meeting with and coming to consensus with the rest of the group
members, Adam and Claire will take charge of the organization and written portion of
the project proposal. Claire will focus on describing the application of the walkthrough
method to the Spotify app, while Adam will focus on expanding the proposal to explain
our emphasis on the social implications of our findings. The group will work together on
making sure all parts of the proposal are aligned with our mutual understanding of the
project.

#### Introduction: Maxine and Sarah
Description: After reconvening with the group and making any necessary modifications
or edits to our original plan, Maxine and Sarah will carry out the written portion of the
project introduction. For the experimental part of our data-collection efforts, Claire will
take on the role of the new female user, and will explore the free version of Spotify and
record findings. Maxine will simulate the role of a new male user and will also use the
free version. Adam will use his family-plan premium account and record findings as a
long-time male user. Sarah will use her student-plan premium account to model a longtime female userâ€™s experience. Sarah will then also write up the technical walkthrough
portion of this introduction. Maxine and Sarah will come together to outline why our
project is important, and then branch out towards the various focal points that we want
to gain insights on.

#### Presentation: Danielle and Ben
Description: Having explored the app in depth with the group, Danielle and Ben will
now construct a visual presentation to show the rest of the class our conclusions. Using
a combination of Microsoft Office tools as well as other mediums of communication,
Danielle and Ben will utilize infographics, data tables, graphs, videos, and spoken parts
in order to find the most intuitive way to communicate each finding from our exploration.
Each member will help with the portions of the findings that they were in charge of, and
will communicate directly with Danielle and Ben to ensure accurate visual
representations of data and insights. Everyone will then participate in the active
presentation.
